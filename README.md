# nigerian_billionaires_analysis

The number of billionaires in a country says a lot about the business environment, startup success rate, and many other economic features of the country. 
So, in this project, i wanted to learn more about the relationships among the richest people in Nigeria using Python.
The dataset that I am using to analyze the data was collected by me. 
I collected the information i needed from both reliable and non-reliable websites. I collected data on the top 100 richest Nigerians I could find. 

The dataset contains information about Nigerian billionaires in 2022, including their:

Names
Net Worth (In Billions)
Age
State of Origin
Source of Wealth
Industry
